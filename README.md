## My process

### Built with

-   Tailwind
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project was the first one in which I created a dark mode. The technique I chose to go with was to create a theme context. That gave me a boolean variable that I could access in order to apply tailwind classes conditionally. It also exports a function for switching the theme which is used in the app header.

```js
const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

export const useTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext);

export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
    const [dark, setDark] = useState(false);
    const changeTheme = () => {
        setDark(!dark);
    };
    const value = {
        dark,
        changeTheme,
    };
    return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
};
```
